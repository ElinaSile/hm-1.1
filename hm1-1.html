      <div class="intro-description-1">
        The International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConferences SGEM
        (Survey, Geology, Ecology and Management) are focused on GLOBAL WARMING,
        CLIMATE CHANGE, CO2 REDUCTION, BIODIVERSITY, AND GREEN TECHNOLOGIES FOR
        A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE.<div />
        <div class="intro-description-2">
        It is our firm belief that, Earth & Planetary Sciences are the most
        crucial part of modern thought, which could prompt an ecological and
        social evolution. Every single piece of extant matter on planet Earth
        contains the DNA of the whole Universe. We could only imagine how much
        pivotal knowledge, how many alternative energy sources and important
        answers are waiting still hidden for us. There is so much yet to be
        discovered! The more we explore, the bigger grows our perception for the
        possibilities beyond what we accept as a fact. Nowadays, since we faced
        the limits of our home planet’s resources and the need to develop new
        methods to solve the current environmental and social problems, we
        should reconsider our technological activities.

          The International Multidisciplinary Scientific Conferences on Earth
          and Planetary Sciences SGEM (known in the International Scientific
          World as SGEM GeoConferences) have strong peer review process for all
          the submitted abstracts and manuscripts. There is a single or double
          blinded peer review (regarding the stage of the workflow process), to
          ensure an independent and transparent process between authors and
          reviewers.The entire peer review process takes within 2 or 3 weeks
          after abstract/manuscript submission, according to the number of
          submitted manuscripts.
